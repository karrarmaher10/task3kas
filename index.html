          <p>
            The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by Ibn Saud. He
            united the four regions into a single state through a series of
            conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh, the
            ancestral home of his family, the House of Saud.

          <p>
            At other times, the region existed in relative obscurity and
            isolation, although from the 7th century the cities of Mecca and
            Medina had the highest spiritual significance for the Muslim world,
            with Mecca becoming the destination for the Hajj pilgrimage, an
            obligation, at least once in a believer's lifetime, if at all
            possible.
